I have used Matlab for the assignment. In the folder 'code' you will find 2 matlab code, the Stability check, the function which checks the assembly whether it collapes or not.
and the Assign5testing runs all the examples required to complete the project. 
The Result folder contains the copy of command window after running the codes using the given assembly as well as using the new assembly.
the result folder also include the image of the new assembly. 
Thankyou for reviewing!
