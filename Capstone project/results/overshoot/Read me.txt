Hi, i have implemented the tasks exactly as mentioned in the wiki using matlab. i encountered lot of errors and after 5-6 days of continous iteration, finally reached the approximate results.
i have used a velocity limits to the joints and provided singularity constraints while using the psudo inverse. The challenging part is finding the suitable gain matrices for the relevent trajectory.
Hope you appriciate my effort and thankyou for reviewing.
